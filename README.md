# webresult
The same "wahiyad" result script is accommodated in Django framework in the back-end to make it web accessible.
The front-end is made using reactjs.

The main branch is deployed to heroku using gunicorn python WSGI http server.  
The react_front directory holds the Reactjs code and gh-pages branch hold its build release in production.  
The main_old branch is without the use of Reactjs, using the default template engine of django.  
  
Deployment available at https://result1822.herokuapp.com/ , watch and rate it yourself.
